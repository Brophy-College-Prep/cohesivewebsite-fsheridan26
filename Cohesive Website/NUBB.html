  <p> In case you are interested, working at the number factory isn't too hard.</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p> Workers at the number factory shoot me out onto a peg board filled with tasty numbers. Yummers! The more I bounce, the more pegs I pop and the more score is produced. If I reach a high enough score, then the board can restock, producing more Nubbies, and eventually adding in more numbers for me to pop. But explaining is one thing, how would you like to see a worker of the number factory do their job? </p>
