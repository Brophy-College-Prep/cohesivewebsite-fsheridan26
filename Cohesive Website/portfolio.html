  <p> Hi, I'm Nubby, and I work at the Number Factory.</p>
  <div class="parallaxthree"></div>
  <p> I'm a bio-engineered organism coveted for my superb bouncing and number-creating abilities. Every day the workers at the number factory use me to create larger and larger numbers! I guess you can call me a big deal. </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p> But you might be asking what happens why do we make big numbers? Well we are the only company that creates numbers, so without us the number market would be drained dry. But also if we don't make enough numbers, then the sun explodes. </p>
  <br>

    <p> It's crazy, I know. But luckily we have lots of trained workers to make big numbers and make sure the sun doesn't explode. If you want to see what it is like to be a worker in the factory, go to the gameplay sections and check it out!</p>
